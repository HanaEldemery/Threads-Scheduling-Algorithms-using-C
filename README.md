# Operating Systems
I developed a foundational framework by implementing threads and experimenting with various scheduling algorithms using the pthreads library in C. My project included the creation of four distinct threads, each containing at least three print statements to output the thread ID for identification purposes. I studied and implemented several scheduling algorithms, including First-In-First-Out (FIFO), Round Robin and the Other scheduling algorithm (default scheduling behavior of the system, often a more complex and dynamic approach that can include priority-based or weighted algorithms), to observe their effects on thread execution and output. I conducted detailed experiments to compare how these algorithms influenced the scheduling and performance of the threads.
